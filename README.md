# Computer Vision Food Recognition and Nutritional Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to develop a computer vision application that can scan images, recognize and label food items within the image, provide their nutritional profiles, and suggest recipes based on the identified ingredients. The application will be web-based, allowing users to upload images for analysis. While the primary focus is on functionality, efforts will be made to create a simple and intuitive user interface. The project will be built using Python with Streamlit as the web application interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- HTML/CSS
- Kaggle Food Recognition Challenge Dataset
- HuggingFace (potentially for recipe recommendations)

## Deep Learning Model
A deep learning network will be constructed using TensorFlow to detect and classify food items in images. OpenCV may also be explored as an alternative depending on performance and accuracy. The model will be trained on images from the Kaggle Food Recognition Challenge Dataset and supplemented with additional data obtained online. This will involve solving a multi-class classification problem by combining computer vision and classification techniques.

## Nutritional Information
Nutritional information for identified food items will be retrieved from a database or flat file. The application will display the nutritional profile of ingredients detected in the uploaded image, including metrics such as "Overall Estimated Protein" or "Overall Estimated Vitamin B12" calculated based on the ingredients' nutritional values.

## Recipe Suggestions
While the recipe component is a desired feature, it will be implemented after the core functionality is completed. Options for recipe suggestions include using a recommender system or a natural language model like HuggingFace to recommend meal ideas based on the identified ingredients. This feature will enhance the application's usability by providing users with recipe suggestions using the foods detected in their images.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-recognition-app.git`
2. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Obtain the Kaggle Food Recognition Challenge Dataset and any additional data for model training.
4. Develop and train the deep learning model using TensorFlow or OpenCV.
5. Implement the Flask application for web-based functionality, integrating the model for food recognition and nutritional analysis.
6. Optionally, incorporate a recipe recommendation system using HuggingFace or other tools.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy and performance through iterative training and fine-tuning.
- Enhance user interface design and experience for a more polished application.
- Expand nutritional analysis capabilities to include more detailed metrics and insights.
- Incorporate additional datasets or APIs for broader food recognition and nutritional information coverage.
- Implement the recipe suggestion feature using a recommender system or natural language model.
